# code-refactor-homework

This repo is a code refactor.  The original page does not use semantic HTML and is not accessible.  My code refactor adds semantic HTML and consolidates CSS so the code is cleaner and is easier for screen readers to use.

Some changes I made were adding header and footer tags, adding alt for accessibility, and changing the title.
